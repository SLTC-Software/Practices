# Project Plan Template

## Introduction

This section should contain a very brief description of the problem the project is solving and how it will solve it. Normally this section should be 3 to 5 sentances and aimed at someone who is familiar with the work done at the Salt Lake Technical Center and the Division in which the project is being produced, but not necesseraly with the problem. Links are appropriate. 

## Version 1.0

Each version of the project can have a *brief* introduction. Usually 1-2 sentances. 

### Feature List

Features are the next part of the following sentance: **This project should**...

| Feature | Priority |Hrs| Comment |
| :----------------------------------- |:-----|:-----| :-----------------------------------:|
| Import data from LISA |must|1||
| Conduct calculations as described in wiki (link)|must|2||
| Print out results |must|2||
| Look like this (link) |should|3||
| Check the calculations |should|2||
| Allow for ambiguity of input |may|2.5||
| Solve world hunger |may|2.5| If you need an extra half hour, that's ok|

Few things to notice:
* The priorities should always be three, divided about equally by time
* A typical project will have all **must** elements done, together with some **should**
* The list can be recreated for the next version with completed items removed, most bugs will be a **must**
* Links are obviously ok, in fact anything that takes a while to explain should be in a wiki, linked to from here
* **Hrs** is an estimated time, estimated by the developer

### Timeline

For a typical project, a version will simply have a deadline that is less than a month away. Projects should be planned so that they do not go longer than a month. Longer projects should be clear about which elements are important first and which will be important later. Then they should be split into multiple versions appropriately. Use wiki to stay organized.
