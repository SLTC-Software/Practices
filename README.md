# Software Managment at the Salt Lake Technical Center

This document outline the software practices in use at the Salt Lake Technical Center. It is not a replacement for the software development SOP in the IHC Division, but a supplement.

## Git

All code must be in Git, hopefully on GitHub. If you are not familiar with Git or GitHub, please see [this](https://github.com/SLTC-Software/Class). 

## Project Plan

Project plan should be finished for each project commenced after August 17th, 2015. If you are not sure where to start, look at [this](SLTC%20Project%20Plan.md). This is not meant to be a major chore, just to make sure the project is aimed at something and that there is no scope creep.

## Documentation

Minimum documentation expected for each project is described [here](SLTC%20Documentation.md). More is always better. 

## README

The README.md file is the first thing anyone will see when they look at your repository on GitHUB. As such it should give a brief introduction to the project and a way to run it. Assume that the people who are trying to run the software already have all the files that you have in your repository.

## Wiki

Wiki is there to make long-range plans, explain certain specific things for the users, or have users discuss features. Use the wiki on GitHub for anything that is a "supporting document". 

## Bug Reports

All bug reports should be tracked through GitHub issue tracker.
